## Setup instructions
For the network requests to work you must set your own API_KEY value in your gradle.properties file.
Example:
```
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
/gradle.properties is listed in the [.gitignore](.gitignore#L10) file so you can safely add this file locally.

If you do not have an api key, first register with themoviedb.org and then request API access from
https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
