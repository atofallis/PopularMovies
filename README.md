## Setup instructions
For the network requests to work you must set your own [api_key value in api.xml](app/src/main/res/values/api.xml#L3) under the resources directory.

api.xml is listed in the [.gitignore](.gitignore#L10) file so you can safely modify this file.

If you do not have an api key, first register with themoviedb.org and then request API access from
https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
